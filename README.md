# Welcome, one and all to brand new way of using google sheets and python to make you Dungeon Master experience, easier, better and less calculation heavy.

This should make your lives easier once we get base abstraction working on all classes, currently this is a very specific working example with tons of hard coding. 

There will be a more abstract useable version with base classes that will allow any one to spin up and play. 

Several things you need to do to allow for Google Sheets to work with python is Enable the Google Sheets API and Create a service account to access this page. 

There are many tutorials on how to do this, (Youtube, Git, etc) but if you request one in the issues board I would be more than happy to create one for this project.
