# Pokemon_Table_Top
Please note I do not own the likeness or assets they are owned by The Pokemon Company, GameFreak and Nintendo. This repository is for eductaion purposes only. It is a project to show the viability of GoogleSheets and Python. Allowing users to interact with the each other through the sheet exclusively. The goal is to make table tops more casual, less math based adventure. To some this project may seem like a gross simplification of the game they have all come to know and love, but having the ability to play this game together side by side is why it works. You can challenge your friends to battles, trade, catch them all, the choice is yours alone! To be only limited by your imagination, is the goal of this project.

# Welcome, one and all to brand new way of using google sheets and python to make you Table Top experience, easier, better and less calculation heavy.

This should make your lives easier once we get base abstraction working on all classes, currently this is a very specific working example with tons of hard coding. 

There will be a more abstract useable version with base classes that will allow any one to spin up and play. 

Several things you need to do to allow for Google Sheets to work with python is Enable the Google Sheets API and Create a service account to access this page. 

There are many tutorials on how to do this, (Youtube, Git, etc) but if you request one in the issues board I would be more than happy to create one for this project. If you guys wish I can help post a video of how to do this. 

Currently this project is in its infancy. I am creating base classes to perfrom some of the more tedious tasks, setting up a spreadsheet, performing stat calculations per level, randomizing IV's and Nature, keeping track of pokemon's Effort Values, etc...

I will be writing some classes to build an RNG encounter table based on current route. There will be a new tab generated that will handle "Random Encounters" and let you influence the rolls. 

I also have plans to build a damage calculator for battles. Players will specify which Pokemon they lead with and then they will get EV's, and experience based on the pokemon they have fought.
